# falkon-bookmarks
As described in https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=393618, falkon cannot sync bookmarks so far.  Since the bookmarks are saved in "%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\falkon\profiles\default\bookmarks.json" in Windows, I tried to sync this file via some cloud services, like OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox... etc.  However, neither creating a symbolic link nor creating a hard link point to bookmarks.json in these services' sync folders successfully sync bookmarks.json.  On one hand, the modified date of the symbolic link does not updated when falkon changes bookmarks.json so the cloud services don't know the bookmarks are updated.  On the other hand, falkon breaks the hard link when the bookmarks are updated.  Creating a symbolic link pointing to the folder containing bookmarks.json works for OneDrive, but I am not sure whether this method syncs too many things and have any security issues...  Therefore, before falkon release its syncing service, I create the git repository to sync falkon bookmarks in my computers...
